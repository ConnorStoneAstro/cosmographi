    Base class for representing astronomical surveys.

    The survey is composed of a table of observations, each with attributes such
    as right ascension (RA), declination (Dec), time of observation, and
    observing conditions. Each observation should also be represented by a
    unique key. This way one can query the survey for matching observations to
    get a set of keys, then use those keys to retrieve the relevant observation
    attributes.
