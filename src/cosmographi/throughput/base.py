class Throughput:
    """Stores throughput curves

    These combine bandpass filters, atmosphere throughput, mirror/lens and other
    hardware throughput.

    This object holds the wavelength and transmission curves for batched filters
    including all effects between the atmosphere and the CCD. The primary
    attributes are w and T. w is the wavelength (nm) array corresponding to the
    wavelengths at which the transmissions are evaluated. T is the transmission
    array, the first dimension indexes the filters, the second gives the
    transmission corresponding to the wavelength array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    names : list of str
        Names of the filters in the throughput.
    w : array-like
        Wavelength array (nm) for the throughput curves. Can be 1D or 2D. If 1D, it is assumed to be the same for all filters.
    T : array-like
        Transmission array for the throughput curves. Should be 2D with shape (n_filters, n_wavelengths).
